Currently just a copy of my original FDF repo.

## 📑 Introduction
This is a project that aim's to port my first ever graphical project, FDF, to make it run on a Aroma configured Wii U. <br>
This project is only for learning purpose, and because I thought it would be fun and stupid.

## 🖥️ Description
The fdf project involves creating a program that reads in a file containing altitude data and uses this data to generate a 3D wireframe representation of a landscape. The program uses the minilibx library to create a graphical window and draw lines that connect each point in the landscape, creating a wireframe mesh.

To accomplish this, the program must first read in the file containing altitude data and parse the data to create a two-dimensional array representing the landscape. The program must then use this array to calculate the coordinates of each point in the wireframe mesh and draw lines between these points using the minilibx library.
